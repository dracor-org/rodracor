# newdracor

Starter repository for new DraCor corpora

This is a template repository you can use to start a new DraCor corpus. After
creating a new repository you need to:

- adjust [corpus.xml](corpus.xml)
  - replace all instances of "new" with the short name of the new corpus
  - edit the `<title>` element
  - edit the `<projectDesc>`
  - edit the `<revisionDesc>` to reflect the current date and status
- edit this README and replace this text with information about your corpus
